                <h2>Galileo telescope</h2>
                <p>
                    While Galileo is often credited with devising the first telescopes, 
                    there was actually a Dutch man called Hans Lippershay who had been
                    making magnification devices using the ever improving qualities of 
                    glassmaking at the time.
                        Allegedly, Galileo heard about these and decided to build his own, 
                    even making some improvements in the process. He was also the first 
                    person to use these new optics as a scientific instrument, which is 
                    where his real value was added.

                <h2>Philo Farnsworth</h2>
                <p>
                    An excellent example of an invention that was only possible thanks to numerous other inventions across industries.
					Farnsworth was able to take the developments of the cathode ray tube (by Ferdinand Braun) and combine it with a way to scan images using electrons which he apparently began thinking of in high school.
					His design also outperformed the other competing TV technology at the time: mechanical TV.

                <h2>Henry Ford car</h2>
                <p>
                    Ford released the Model T in 1908, and it was the first car to gain mass market appeal and success at a time when many people still travelled by horse.
					However, the car as powered by an internal combustion engine was actually created by Karl Benz in 1885, and many other engineers subsequently improved on the design for better efficiency, comfort and performance.
					What Ford achieved was improve the production process of the machine. His assembly line improved production efficiency significantly, bringing down the cost of each unit to a price point where people could actually afford it.
